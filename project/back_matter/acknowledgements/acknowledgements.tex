\MatterHeading{Acknowledgements}

\noindent I owe particular thanks to Anna Krivolapova, who, through insistence rather than encouragement, made publication unavoidable at a moment when avoidance would have been easier. Tom Will must be thanked as well, for being better than me, and \textit{always} being around to talk \textit{poesy}. I am also grateful to Peter Guitl and the rest of the crew at \textit{Frontier Magazine} for first publishing \textit{Ruin’s} "Apologia", "The Festival Is Over", and "Not Orpheus, I", and for carrying those poems far beyond their New Orleans birthplace. Additionally, the priceless editrix of \textit{Spectra}, Erica Avey, was kind enough to let me debut "Quartet For Two" in her journal. 

\medskip
\noindent I have also to thank the readers who continued to show up for History, and who stuck with me while poem after poem was workshopped, revised, discarded, and tried again. My sole condition for publishing this first book was that I remain responsible for every aspect of it that could be brought under my control; accordingly, any errors, mechanical or curatorial, are mine entirely.
