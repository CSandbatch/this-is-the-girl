\MatterHeading{Afterword}

\noindent This afterword is a placeholder for the proof edition.
It is intentionally generic: it exists to reserve space, confirm back-matter styling, and test the transition out of the final piece.

\medskip
\noindent In this draft, the body is arranged as three linked sequences: \OpusName{L’Obsession}, \OpusName{Ruin}, and \OpusName{Désir}.
Each sequence reuses motifs (breath, weather, city-light, appetite) under different pressures, shifting from fixation to aftermath to a more durable kind of tenderness.

\medskip
\noindent Replace this page with a real note once the book's order and titles have settled.
