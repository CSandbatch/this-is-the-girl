\begin{stanza}
Oh my dear, timid in your ways,\\
you offer from your quiet grace\\
from hills of opal, lakes serene.\\
The violets lift a yearning face\\
bloom toward sunlight’s golden sheen.\\
Smile, Oh sun. Not even the god\\
who fills our veins with holy fire\\
can veil your blaze. We are the rod,\\
the virgin shoots of pure desire,\\
sprouting from fertile boughs anew.\\
Smile, Oh my sea, smile once again,\\
with love and glory shining through.\\
A bride to you, tonight, I bring.
\end{stanza}
