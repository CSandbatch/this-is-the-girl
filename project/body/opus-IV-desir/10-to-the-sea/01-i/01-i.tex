\begin{stanza}
To the sea, to the sea, my dear, come, be near\\
my free, green Adriatic, fragrant, clear,\\
sad as a song and sacred to the now,\\
to the poets’ sea, whose salt has touched my brow.\\
From the rocks, look—fresh and bright,\\
Juno’s dawn emerges, sharp with light.\\
A shiver of silver stirs the sea,\\
and the flowering woods sing to the wind.\\
Zephyrus sings his wedding songs.\\
My dear, you hear? From porch and wall,\\
through every vein the sap ascends,\\
a warm, invading conqueror bends.
\end{stanza}
