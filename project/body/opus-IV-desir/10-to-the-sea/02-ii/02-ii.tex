\begin{stanza}
See how, from every alder’s shade,\\
the joy of greenness rises free\\
and lifts toward dawn in leaf and blade.\\
Don’t you hear their ecstasy?\\
Don’t you hear the songs that rise,\\
voluptuous on rosy tides?\\
Don’t you stretch forth your arms in praise\\
to take the gifts our hands provide?
\end{stanza}
