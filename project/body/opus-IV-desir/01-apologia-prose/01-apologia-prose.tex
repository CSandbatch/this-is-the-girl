\begin{prosepoem}
Desire, though—desire is true sensuality. You woke up together,
maybe. You know how when people sleep together often enough
their hearts start to sync, not exactly \textit{ba-dum ba-dum} but more
like \textit{babadum-dum}—off, human, a little drunk. It’s a song,
not a gong. Desire is what happens when you wake up together
and your hearts and your hangovers are both doing that.

Desire can last. It lives with smells and rough skin. Desire
arrives knowing Obsession was a joke.

“None of this matters after you meet each other,” my friend
said, but he says \textit{nunns’dis matters} to everything. “A Sensualist
is not merely a hedonist,” says Anna Krivolapova:

\begin{quote}
A Sensualist is a man who is sentimental to the
point of wickedness, a sanguine melancholy that
becomes its own weather system. Pleasure, joy, and
rage ferment inside his chest, to a level that can
only be tempered with Education.
\end{quote}

I like that. Desire is Obsession educated by Ruin. I don’t
know if I’ve ever felt true desire.
