\PoemHead{Letter Lost}{}

\begin{stanza}
From gold I have gathered\\
only the strain of striving.\\
I staked my future\\
untied my rope and slipped away.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Now I wait in patience,\\
put no faith in Fortune,\\
plant no roots in borrowed shade.\\
A stranger’s share is all I find,\\
my fate lost like a letter never sent.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I’ve cried out to the Sun;\\
who turned away,\\
knowing not my face.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Where is my companion,\\
the one who knows the path?\\
Perhaps my voice will drift\\
to him across this field.
\end{stanza}
