\PoemHead{Kindness Returns Downriver}{}

\begin{stanza}
No longer for you the sunwild plain,\\
nor the bottomless guilt of absence,\\
choose now channels where shadows gurgle over root,\\
playing their songs on stone.\\
Cut loose the anchor!\\ 
May strong current teach you rest.\\
Run freely in the blackdrift.\\
Doubt is but sand and wind.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Patience.\\ 
It is the slow swirl under cypress knees.\\
Turn from envy—its teeth gnaw at the nerves.\\
Let sorrow’s ripples pass.\\
Speak only what the cattails know.\\
Smile as the water closes round a stone.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Forgive the stumbles of those moving through the reeds\\
come back to kindness as river returns to mouths.\\
Let longing stand in the low mist,\\
forget wrongs, noble-hearted,\\
as the heron forgets the snare,\\
lifting into the pale margin of morning.
\end{stanza}
