\PoemHead{Song for the Stranger}{}

\begin{stanza}
Oh you who wander, I greet you with palms open!\\
Step down from your steed, set your feet in the grass and dew.\\
Let rise your breath with the starlight;\\
Shoulders dipped in smoke and cloud.\\
See how the night throws its great drape over the fields?\\
I call to you, yes, you, to you!\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Riding there, body ghosted in lamplight.\\
Stride toward the high, unspeaking calling.\\
Harvest what the day’s hand has sown.\\
Let the coins of now gleam in your satchel,\\
contented with bread, contented with darkness,\\
singing away the old world’s blame.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Wander the shining, sunlit road,\\
where the high cliffs become blue mist.\\
Dress your soul in the dress of forgiveness,\\
let your faith pulse like clean cool air—\\
You stranger I see, moving always between light and shade.
\end{stanza}
