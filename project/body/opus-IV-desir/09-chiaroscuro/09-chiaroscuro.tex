\PoemHead{Chiaroscuro}{}

\begin{stanza}
Past the reach of your fire, knowledge sleeps,\\
cool in the half-dark, patience sifting tangled roots.\\
Trouble and peace coil together like smoke and dawn.\\
Hunt your supper in the shadow of the sycamore,\\
curse not the rising silt when it stains your boots.\\
Want only what half-blooms in shade and sun.\\
Let your call drift, neither whispered nor shouted.\\
Forgiveness beads on the leaf, waiting for the wind.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Companions in heart! Let patience rend your days\\
when the bitch of luck flees and hunger tugs.\\
All is washed away—moondark blurs to riverlight.\\
Desire dissipates, shallow friends recede.\\
Wisdom’s shade walks before you on the bank.\\
See how the World, candle-lit and clouded,\\
turns and glances away, shadowed in mystery.\\
Keep wrapt your scars, as fox pups in the canebrake.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Walk upright, shadow-draped, humility your shield.\\
Move quiet through places where sunlight doesn’t pool,\\
and journey on, starlit, as silence closes ’round behind you.
\end{stanza}
