\PoemHead{Rotflower, Rotflower}{}

\begin{stanza}
Rotflower, rotflower, come you to me.\\
Come broke, come bitch-hewn, come painted to be\\
The saints in my the window, there’s drink in the drawer.\\
I want the perfume of a body gone sore.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Breathe me your breath like a funeral bell,\\
your hips like prophecy, dressed up for hell.\\
The girls in the hallway are starting to scream\\
your smile’s my ruin, you fuck like a dream.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Rotflower, rotflower, teeth in your stem.\\
I ate all your scars and I savored them.\\
The plaster is cracking, the altar is wet.\\
Your tanline a dare I won’t forget.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Come dirty, come eaten, come dragging the sea.\\
Roll on your latex, and come dance with me.\\
I devoured your name, \& I begged for the more\\
I want our bodies to entwine at the core.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Rotflower, rotflower, bloom out of spite.\\
You bled on my chest and you came in the night.\\
There’s saints in the windows who spit at the floor.\\
So leave them their heaven then give me some more.
\end{stanza}
