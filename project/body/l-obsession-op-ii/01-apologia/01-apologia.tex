\PoemHead{Apologia}{}

\begin{prosepoem}
So what is obsession? Let me show you. Obsession starts without hope. It’s born in strange places \& sideways looks in public places. Obsession starts in a conversation with someone you maybe just thought you wanted to fuck.

Obsession starts without hope.

I’ve fallen back on form here because obsession has form. Every work of art is an uncommitted crime, and every artist is a kind of criminal, driven by an obsession with what he alone sees.

Obsession— it has form until it doesn’t. It is a fixation. A line or an idea that enters your mind once and either flows back out or sticks but either way it comes howling back in; there’s nothing you can do.

Obsession has shape \& if it has shape it has form here is the form.
