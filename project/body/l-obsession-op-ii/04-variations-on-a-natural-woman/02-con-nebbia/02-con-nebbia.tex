\PoemHead{II: Con Nebbia}{(With Mist/Static)}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do, seeing me stare\\
at your calves, blanketed lightly (yes, really) in hair\\
Oh, sunlight entwined, Oh static in the riverbend\\
where the phones don't ring and levee roads end.\\
I’ve drunk all my wine with nothing to share,\\
but what would you do, seeing me stare?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Some lace on the sill radio hiss, the damp of old rooms\\
a flutter (it skips) of longing in lemon-tree blooms.\\
It is nothing, you say, just a street in the sun,\\
but your calves in the daylight (the way you run)\\
I will think of the salt on your skin, your disordered care.\\
And what would you do, seeing me stare?
\end{stanza}
