\PoemHead{III: Capriccioso, dissoluto}{}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do, seeing me stare\\
at your calves, blanketed lightly unshaven \& bare\\
Touched by the day. Sunlight, river-bend,\\
narrow streets, where levee roads end.\\
I’ve drunk all my wine (left my glass there)\\
But what would you do,\\
if you saw me stare?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Some lace on the sill, and musk slathered rooms\\
(a scent I keep finding in afternoon gloom).\\
You say it is nothing a street, some sun\\
But your calves in the daylight, they blur as you run\\
I’ll remember the salt on your skin, the ick in your glare.\\
Does it bother you? This?\\
That I’m losing my hair?
\end{stanza}
