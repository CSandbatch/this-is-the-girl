\PoemHead{IV: Sognante}{(Dreamlike)}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do\\
\quad seeing me stare\\
at your calves unshaven wild\\
\quad light gilding the hair\\
(sun spooled in the river’s bend,\\
\quad where narrow streets lean,\\
levee roads end).\\
\quad I’ve drunk all my wine\\
with nothing to spare\\
\quad but what would you do,\\
seeing me stare?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
\quad Some lace, a crooked sill\\
the stink of old rooms\\
\quad snaked into you,\\
a twinkle of longing,\\
\quad \& lemon-tree blooms\\
It is nothing, you say,\\
\quad just a street in the sun,\\
but the shock of your calves!\\
\quad my heart flutters and runs\\
But I’ll think of the salt\\
\quad on your skin, your careless air.\\
I wish you’d come over!\\
\quad and be my fine mare\dots
\end{stanza}
