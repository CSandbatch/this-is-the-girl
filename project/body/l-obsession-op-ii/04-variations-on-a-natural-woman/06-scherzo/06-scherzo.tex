\PoemHead{VI: Scherzo alla Shatter}{}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do, seeing me stare\\
\quad At your calves covered, golden, frankly in hair,\\
catching the last of the Bywater light,\\
\quad Rays drifting sideways, just beyond riversight.\\
I’ve drunk all my wine (left the bottle somewhere)\\
\quad but what are you doing, watching me stare?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Still lace on the sill, the musk of old rooms\\
\quad Our shimmery static, in lemon-tree blooms.\\
It is nothing, you say, just a street just the sun\\
\quad but your calves, in that light on the run\\
I will taste of the salt, \& bend you over my chair!\\
\quad Now what will you do?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
\quad You know I’m standing there?\\
\quad I'll just be right there\dots
\end{stanza}
