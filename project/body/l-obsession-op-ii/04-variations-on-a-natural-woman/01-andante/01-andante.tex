\PoemHead{I: Andante con Moto}{}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do, seeing me stare\\
At your calves, blanketed lightly in hair\\
Oh, sunlight entwined in the rivers soft bend,\\
Where narrow the streets and the levee roads end.\\
I’ve drunk all my wine, with nothing to spare\\
But what would you do, seeing me stare?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Some lace on the sill, and the musk of old rooms,\\
A spring twig of longing under lemon-tree blooms.\\
It is nothing, you say, just a street in the sun,\\
But your calves in the daylight, the way that you run\\
I will think of the salt on your skin and your care.\\
But what would you do, seeing me stare?
\end{stanza}
