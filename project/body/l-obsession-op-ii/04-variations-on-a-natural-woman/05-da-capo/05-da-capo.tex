\PoemHead{V: Da Capo}{(Return)}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do,\\
\quad seeing me stare\\
At your calves,\\
\quad blanketed lightly in hair?\\
Oh, sunlight entwined\\
\quad in the river’s soft bend,\\
Where narrow the streets\\
\quad and the levee roads end.\\
I’ve drunk all my wine,\\
\quad with nothing to spare\\
But what would you do,\\
\quad seeing me stare?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Some lace on the sill,\\
\quad and the musky old rooms,\\
A flicker of longing\\
\quad in lemon-tree blooms.\\
It is nothing, you say,\\
\quad just a street in the sun,\\
But your calves in the daylight,\\
\quad the way that you run\\
I will think of the salt\\
\quad on your skin and I care.\\
Just what you would do,\\
\quad seeing me stare?
\end{stanza}
