\PoemHead{We Tell Ourselves Stories}{}

\begin{stanza}
What’s funny is we really do say I love you\\
\quad as goodbye in Los Angeles. You were dressed\\
in nothing but a tan line and one shoe.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I watched your ankle flex. You sort of confessed\\
\quad you’d slept with someone else last week, or not\\
the past was traffic, and you weren’t impressed.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Your toes were blistered from the heat. I thought\\
\quad they looked like grapes embalmed in reddish paint.\\
You let me touch you, then said, \textit{Please don’t get caught.}\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
The ceiling fan revolved, deliberate and faint.\\
\quad You fixed your gaze on the vent’s dull brass\\
reflected once, then gone. A kind of saint?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I flipped a quarter and it landed on your ass.\\
\textit{I love you} is how you say goodbye in Cyberspace,\\
\quad too.
\end{stanza}
