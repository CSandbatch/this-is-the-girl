\PoemHead{Let the Flower Bleed}{}

\begin{stanza}
Thundering witness, paradise plume,\\
From the cracks in the ancient pavement you bloom,\\
Last night’s lipstick, and gin on your breath.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Neighbors are whispering under the moon\\
Your slips at your ankles, you’re mocking the priest.\\
Thundering witness, paradise plume.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Once you wore white, now you haunt every room,\\
Perfume of wild nights and broken bequests,\\
From the cracks in the ancient pavement you bloom.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Who counted the lovers you lost before noon?\\
Who kissed you in rain while the city confessed?\\
Thundering witness, paradise plume.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Petals rain gently, announcing your doom\\
You laugh at the ruin, you dare what is left.\\
From the cracks in the ancient pavement you bloom.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Scandalous beauty, obscene as a wound\\
Your dance in the heat, in the dress you undress.\\
Thundering witness, paradise plume,\\
From the cracks in the ancient pavement you bloom.
\end{stanza}
