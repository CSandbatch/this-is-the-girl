\PoemHead{\textsc{Maybe I'm Not a Poet}}{}

\begin{stanza}
Thank you for fixing our\\
\hspace{1em}planter box,\\
reads the sign I notice,\\
\hspace{1em}lying sideways,\\
pushed over,\\
as I stop\\
to light a cigarette.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
And I thought\\
on kindnesses,\\
both received\\
and unseen,\\
and they all became\\
indistinguishable.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Inscrutable\\
to meet, in the wild,\\

a meaning of our.
\end{stanza}
