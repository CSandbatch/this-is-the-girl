\PoemHead{On Full Faith and Credit}{– after Re(e)vela(ua)tion and the SEC}

\begin{stanza}
The debt is fake—we’ve got the bomb.\\
    Let Nasdaq crash, let hell unpeg.\\
    A blonde uncoils in Oklahoma…\\
The debt is fake! We’ve got the bomb.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
She draws our flag with lipstick balm,\\
    a drone films her from mountain ledge.\\
    The debt is fake! We’ve got the bomb.\\
Let Nasdaq crash, let hell unpeg.
\end{stanza}
