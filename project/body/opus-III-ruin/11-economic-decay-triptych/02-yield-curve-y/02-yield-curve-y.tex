\PoemHead{Yield Curve(y)}{– with mallwalkers and PAWGs}

\begin{stanza}
What’s real is yield, and she is fair.\\
    She walks the mall in just a thong.\\
    Behind her trails a talking bear—\\
what’s real is Yield, and Yield is fair.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
The fountain screams. The air smells spare.\\
    Yield says: “my song is a Revenue Song.”\\
    What’s real is yield, and she was fair.\\
She walks the mall in just a thong.
\end{stanza}
