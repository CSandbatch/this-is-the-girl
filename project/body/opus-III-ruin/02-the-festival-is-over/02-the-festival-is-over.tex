\PoemHead{The Festival Is Over}{}

\begin{stanza}
Our city blazes. Hell ignites our night,\\
\quad Torch-shafts ascending, waltzing in the sky;\\
\quad Bronze windows flare; anonymous, the cry\\
Of revel bursts the pavements, harsh and white.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
But fire feeds also itself. Towers must burn,\\
\quad Flay gay streamers; stuttering them to smoke.\\
\quad Blacken stone lions’ cracking columns. Choke\\
On cinders, winds that wheel with each return.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Ash coils smiling up, scarifying stars,\\
\quad The alleys writhe, each mask dissolved, withdrawn;\\
\quad Gilt to black wick—the city’s past now mars\\
Its own façade, and silence climbs the dawn.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Yet out of ruin, one keen ember gleams—\\
One will, a shard, surviving other dreams.
\end{stanza}
