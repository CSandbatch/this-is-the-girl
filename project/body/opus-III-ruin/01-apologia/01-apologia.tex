\begin{prosepoem}
ruin is when you can’t stop \& can’t go away / ruin is the mayor
cutting a ribbon made of smoke / the senator calls it infrastructure
 \& files a bill to rename the crater / the priest calls it
providence / the banker calls it liquidity \& sells futures to
vegetarians / the general salutes a statue that has already excused
its head

 \ProseInsetLines{%
children are dragging a lion skeleton down main street / while
teachers pass out maps with no borders left / architects stare at
blueprints full of holes \& say symmetry is alive / \& the parade
keeps moving but the drummer has no drum \& just bangs two broken
doors together
}}
\vspace{0.25\baselineskip}

ruin is not aftermath it is atmosphere / it is the reprise
played before the song bends the steel / the orchestra tunes
itself to fire alarms / alleys sing like choirs without throats /
monuments erase their own obituaries / \& everybody claps
cause they got nothing left to drop

 \ProseInsetLines{%
the senator waves again: ``look, progress!'' / the cop pets his
horse / the shopgirl sells souvenirs / the poet eats plaster \&
calls it sacrament / the child holds up a brick as if it were
indeed a dove
}}
\vspace{0.25\baselineskip}

ruin opens its mouth \& lets them bricks fall out / crooked,
burning / call it love if you must / call it ruin if you dare / call
it nothing \& still it will get tangled in your hair

ruin touches everything here is ruin
