\PoemHead{Snow Leopard, Memphis}{}

\begin{stanza}
Tail swish, brief as a wish.\\
Blur behind the painted boulder,\\
And two blue eyes, ancient and cool.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Fix me: stone, boy, and predator.\\
I stand—small, held by her hand\\
(My mother’s brung me to the zoo.)\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Ten feet apart: the spotted monarch,\\
Fur dusted with summer grit.\\
Breath steaming in the foreign heat.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
What could I do, meeting such a gaze?\\
A rare thing.\\
Rare thing, indifferent queen,\\
Seeing through my heartbeat.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Some part of me thinks: let it take me,\\
Let myself be ended by that look—\\
(Rarity should outlast the common.)\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
We, believing ourselves special,\\
Should measure our lives\\
Against the gold\\
In those impossible eyes.
\end{stanza}
