\PoemHead{And What Would You Do?}{}

\begin{stanza}
And what would you do, huh?—\\
\quad if I laid down in the dirt\\
\qquad and opened my veins?—\\
\qquad\quad if I lit my coat on fire\\
\qquad\qquad Watching your eyes reflect it?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
You gonna judge me\\
\quad from your cracked-ice throne?\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I buried my last kitten\\
\quad and never cried—\\
but here I am\\
\quad tearing at snow\\
\qquad like it’s an itching stye.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Think your silence makes you a saint?\\
Say something, goddamn it!\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Say it with those \textit{teeth}
\end{stanza}
