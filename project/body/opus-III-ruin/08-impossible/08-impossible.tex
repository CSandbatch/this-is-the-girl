\PoemHead{Impossible}{}

\begin{stanza}
You know, maybe\\
I’ve never met you,\\
Not even in a picture,\\
But right now you’re a snow leopard—\\
Alone in the high blue cold,\\
Silent, moving where no one else will go.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
\textit{You said it was impossible and snarled}\\
\textit{A little, at the thought…}\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I don’t know your real face,\\
But this one fits:\\
Wild, hidden,\\
Real as anything\\
I can say\\
Dream to hope\\
Hope to dream.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
\textit{…So I thought I’d show you how}\\
\textit{I make things real.}\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
If anyone asks,\\
You’re a snow leopard—\\
And I think, for now,\\
That’s probably true.
\end{stanza}
