\PoemHead{Not Orpheus, I}{}

\begin{stanza}
How does the city sit solitary, that was\\
\quad Full of people; widowed marble, pale with flame?\\
\quad Queen among harbors, empress of all shame,\\
Bride of the burnt, sovereign of our loss.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
No lyre remains. Its thrones are charnel gold.\\
\quad Her dancers gone, the honeyed voices mute\\
\quad Only the wind’s delirium through the chute\\
Of temples razed and columns numb with cold.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Not Orpheus, I—no backward-fixèd gaze,\\
\quad No lyrist’s woe to petrify my feet.\\
Bearing no song for shadows nor sing praise;\\
\quad I gather up my remnant and retreat.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Let Orpheus linger, singing to the dust\\
Choose I the sea, the living, and the must.
\end{stanza}
