\PoemHead{II}{}

\begin{stanza}
A stone upturned, a decade spent;\\
  The snowline glittering, pawprint-faint—\\
    He tracks by absentee intent\\
      On costs that hunter, hunted paint.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
What’s measured here? What grace remains?\\
  He stumbles on—a hunger sharp as morning dew,\\
    Each step a wager, old and new,\\
      A world the claw alone finds true.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
He chambers rounds against the dark,\\
  His thumb at steel, his mind she gnaws\\
    Her eyes ignite, and leave their mark\\
      In all his sight, in flush and calm.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Oh Lord of circles, backward run,\\
  What ends when neither one has won?
\end{stanza}
