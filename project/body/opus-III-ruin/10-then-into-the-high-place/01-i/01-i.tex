\PoemHead{I}{}

\begin{stanza}
The valley gapes, wind-shaken, wide—\\
  Taking the upland trail, with need\\
    And rifle, chimes the hunter’s stride.\\
      He climbs through mountain meadows, freed\\
        By sunlight, spur, and broken reed,\\
      Past limbs of trees and motes of dust;\\
    The bloodless night begins to bleed—\\
  He breathes the cold, accepts its trust.\\
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
What’s left when hunger’s bite is dulled?\\
  He follows spoor, lets thoughts fall slack.\\
    The mountain silence, wire-pulled,\\
      Draws taut, then snaps behind his back—\\
    Still upward, marked by ancient sign,\\
  Those ember eyes that do not pine.
\end{stanza}
