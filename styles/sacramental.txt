REGIME IX — High Baroque / Sacramental Overload

(Cathedral sweat, incense choking the nave, erotic theology)

This is Counter-Reformation excess applied to lyric obsession.

Cormorant Infant – Italic

Running heads / page numbers
Cormorant Infant – Regular (7.5–8 pt)

Effect:
A book that feels dangerously sacred. The poems become confessions overheard by marble saints.
This is the most Catholic possible reading of your work.
