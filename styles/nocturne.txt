REGIME VIII — Nocturne / Black Salt (modern noir with baroque undertow)

This is the cleanest noir option: minimal, tense, contemporary—but with old blood underneath.

Body text
Source Serif 4 – Regular
• Size: 10.75 pt
• Leading: 1.3–1.35×
• Why: tight, controlled, cinematic—lets silence and enjambment do the work.

Italics
Source Serif 4 – Italic
• Cool, precise, emotionally distant.

Opus & section titles
Alegreya SC – Medium
• Small caps ON
• Letterspacing +6
• Why: score-like authority with modern clarity.

Poem titles
Source Serif 4 – Italic

Effect: streetlight, river, gunmetal calm.
This is Gulf Noir without ornament, but not without history.
