# TexGraph - Agent Workflow

This directory documents the repeatable workflow an agent (or human) should follow to:

- Fetch and cache Google Fonts locally (no system installs required).
- Build the full project with LuaLaTeX.
- Generate multiple style proofs for comparison.
- Sweep LaTeX build artifacts while keeping PDFs.
