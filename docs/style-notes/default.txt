Italics
Source Serif 4 – Italic
• Clean, disciplined emphasis

Opus & section titles
Alegreya SC – Medium
• Small caps on
• Letterspacing +5
• Rationale: score-like authority without Roman monumentality

Poem titles

Effect: structured, architectural, musically legible.
Best if the opus concept is foregrounded.
